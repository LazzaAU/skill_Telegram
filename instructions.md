#Telegram skill

## What it does
This skill allows you to chat with Alice or send her commands, with your phone, using the highly privacy centered Telegram app. The app is free and available for both Android and IOS.

## What it does not
Obviously, this skill replaces your physical voice, so it won't add new actions to Alice, but simply bridge your text messages to Alice.

## Install

### On your mobile device
- Go to your app store
- Download Telegram: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger), [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807)
- Once installed, open the app,search for a user named **BotFather** and start chatting with him.
- Send the message **/newbot** and answer the questions asked.
- At the end, you'll get a *token* which you need to insert in the Telegram skill settings. Don't want to type that long string by hand? Easy:
   - Go to [https://web.telegram.org/](https://web.telegram.org/)
   - Open the chat you had with **BotFather** and voil√†!
- Navigate to Alice's interface skill page and open the Telegram skill settings
